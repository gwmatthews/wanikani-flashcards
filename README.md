# Wanikani Flashcards

A `\LaTeX` package and bash script for producing flashcard sets from .csv files generated by Wanikani Item inspector. This repo also has pre-built pdfs of all Wanikani kanji organized in sets of 10 levels, as well as the first 20 levels of vocabulary, one level per file, plus a set of recent leeches of mine. If you want leech cards for yourself you'll have to build your own ;)

## Features

- Generates pdf files with 15 cards per page on letter paper.
- Kanji cards print kanji in larger font size so you can distinguish vocabulary from kanji cards of the same character -- readings are usually different after all!
- Kanji readings are written in katakana, which, while not strictly accurate for all kanji since not all of them have on'yomi readings, at least will give you practice reading katakana.

## Requirements

- `LaTeX` packages:
  - xeCJK
  - nopageno
  - multicol
  - anyfontsize
  - hyperref
  - tcolorbox
  - etoolbox
  - pdfpages
- xelatex
- standard Linux utilities such as sed, awk, grep
- .csv files downloaded from Wanikani Item Insepector with the following settings
	- tables > export > cell separator > comma
	- tables > export > use of quotes > only when needed
	- tables > export > exported column 1 > reading brief
	- tables > export > exported column 2 > item
	- tables > export > exported column 3 > meaning brief
	- tables > export > exported column 4 > item type
	- tables > filters > no radicals

Works with either lists of kanji or vocabulary or both combined. 

Radicals fail to render in many fonts, not to mention the fact that some idiosyncratic radicals are represented in Wanikani by images rather than as text characters.


## How to use

- Copy .csv files to wanikani-flashcards directory and then run `./makecards.sh filename.csv`
- For a4 paper run `./makecards.sh filename.csv a4`
